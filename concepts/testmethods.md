**CONSIDERATIONS & OPINION**

im not a hundred percent sure but i'd guess the step by step method will be way better than the oneshot message.
when i remember correctly was that the stuff anthropic had discovered before the reasoners emerged.
why did we stop with many shot prompting? i should investigate the costs of many shot prompting in comparison to few shot and how these compare to accuracy of the models output.
